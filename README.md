I opted to continue the Grazioso project from my first enhancement and create a database and database management system for it. I used sqlite3 for a lightweight, local solution to the task. This enhancement also did away with the object files for rescue animals, dogs, and monkeys as they were no longer being stored in local vectors and instead created tables where each record was an animal. I also worked on integrating security features to prevent SQL injection attacks and buffer overflows for inputs (especially given that menuChoice is a char type variable). This project was a healthy reminder that even though I am very close to graduating, I still have a lot to learn as a computer scientist as my original plan was to connect the system to a MongoDB database, however after facing challenges with connecting the application to database server, I chose to make this a local database instead. Despite the challenges and frustrations this project presented it was a fun puzzle and I look forward to every challenge that I face in my coming work in the field.

This enhancement met the following goals:

•	Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources.

•	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms).

•	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database).
